## Skill Loading

Before substantial work:
- Skill check: run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest list`, or use skills already listed in context.
- Skill guidance: if one local skill clearly matches the task, run `bunx @tanstack/intent@latest load <package>#<skill>` and follow the returned `SKILL.md`.
- Monorepos: when working across packages, run the skill check from the workspace root and prefer the local skill for the package being changed.
- Multiple matches: prefer the most specific local skill for the package or concern you are changing; load additional skills only when the task spans multiple packages or concerns.

## Essentials

- Package manager: `bun`
- Don't run builds after every change. This is a visual site; assume changes work unless reported otherwise.
- **Typesafety is paramount.** Never cast types; fix at source instead. See [typescript.md](.agents/typescript.md).

- [TypeScript Conventions](.agents/typescript.md): Type inference, casting rules, generic naming
